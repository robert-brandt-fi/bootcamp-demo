# BootcampDemo

The purpose of this project is to make a demo that utilizes API calls and .csv files to present data to the user, based on the user's input. Angular and TypeScript was utilized in the making of this demo, as the author had most recent work experience with them.

## Results
- User can search for an item from a limited pool of items
- Program converts the request into an API call and fetches JSON data
- Data is modified slightly and then shown to the user

## To Do
- Add multi-item search option to the search box
- Dynamically fetch querable items from either .csv or database
- Add the ability to "track" items, so they are automatically fetched and updated
- Improve UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
